## Advent of Code 2022

My attempt at 2022s edition of Advent of Code.
These are not refined solutions, just as long
as they work, I'm happy.

To run a solution, just navigate to the the
folder in terminal and run:

```bash
$ node [name_of_file].js
```

(Note that the input file cannot have a final empty line).
